In the Gazette data, adjuncts are designated with the “Adjunct” label in the title column. Full-time instructional staff will have the label of “Professor” or “Instructor” somewhere in their title. These results are listed in Table 1 showing that several academic departments, including Nursing, Allied Health, International Programs (Global Learning) and Arts/Humanities employ more than half of their instructional staff as contingent faculty. This data cannot be entirely accurate, however, as many adjuncts’ departments are categorized under their regional campus instead of their academic department. Similarly, the Distance Learning department and College Credit in High School represent a wide range of academic departments and it seems adjunct faculty are designated as being in these departments whereas full time faculty would be designated as being in their respective academic departments even when teaching classes for Distance Learning or College Credit in High School departments. Contingent faculty are routinely misrepresented in this data. Given these caveats, the actual number of adjuncts per academic department is likely higher than presented here.\n\n\nShow the code\npercent &lt;- scales::label_percent(accuracy = 1, scale = 100)\n\nsalaries %&gt;%\n  # Filter to obtain only instructional staff; designated with the strings \"adjunct,\" \"instructor,\" or \"professor\"\n  filter(str_detect(title, \"Adjunct|Instructor|Professor\")) %&gt;%\n  \n  # Set a boolean adjunct flag; true if the title contains the string \"adjunct,\" otherwise false.\n  mutate(adjunct = str_detect(title, \"Adjunct\")) %&gt;%\n  \n  # Count the totals of adjunts and non-adjuncts per department.\n  count(department, adjunct) %&gt;%\n  \n  # Group the totals by department.\n  group_by(department) %&gt;%\n  \n  # Get ratios of adjunct and non-adjuncts per department.\n  mutate(p = n / sum(n), `%` = percent(p)) %&gt;%\n  \n  # Show only the adjuncts.\n  filter(adjunct == TRUE) %&gt;%\n  \n  # Arrange in descending ratio.\n  arrange(-p) %&gt;%\n  \n  # Rename the columns.\n  select(Department = department, `Number of adjuncts` = n, `Adjuncts as percentage of faculty` = `%`) %&gt;%\n  \n  # Display the table.\n  knitr::kable()\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Ratio of full and part time instructional staff\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepartment\nNumber of adjuncts\nAdjuncts as percentage of faculty\n\n\n\n\nDistance Learning\n58\n100%\n\n\nIowa City Campus\n20\n100%\n\n\nWilliamsburg Center\n1\n100%\n\n\nCollege Credit in High School\n1\n100%\n\n\nNursing Programs\n88\n84%\n\n\nJones County Regional Center\n3\n75%\n\n\nAllied Health\n41\n66%\n\n\nInternational Programs\n11\n61%\n\n\nArts/Humanities\n28\n55%\n\n\nLinn County Regional Center\n3\n50%\n\n\nBusiness and Information Tech\n18\n44%\n\n\nCommunication/English/Media\n19\n41%\n\n\nSocial Sciences\n17\n39%\n\n\nIndustrial Technologies\n8\n25%\n\n\nHospitality Arts\n2\n25%\n\n\nMath/Science\n10\n19%\n\n\nAgricultural Science\n4\n17%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReuseCC BY 4.0"
